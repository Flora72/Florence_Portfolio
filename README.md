# WELCOME TO MY CREATIVE PORTFOLIO.
# Florence Ndinda — Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a curated space where logic meets emotion and code becomes art. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and a spark of intentional design, this site showcases not just what I do, but who I am.

## About Me

I'm **Florence Ndinda**, a self-driven developer and aspiring writer based in Nairobi, Kenya. My passion spans across cybersecurity, web development, database design, and structured storytelling. I approach each project as a reflection of growth, curiosity, and creative rebellion. From command-line queries, capturing characters through phrases, to clean UI layouts , my work speaks through function and feeling.
