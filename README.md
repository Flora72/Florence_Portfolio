#  Welcome to My Creative Portfolio  
## Florence Ndinda — Developer & Storyteller

Welcome to my personal portfolio a curated sanctuary where logic meets emotion, and code becomes a vessel for healing, rebellion, and reflection. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and a spark of poetic design, this site showcases not just what I do, but who I am.

##  About Me

I'm **Florence Ndinda**, a self-driven developer, aspiring writer, and emotional architect based in Nairobi, Kenya. My work spans cybersecurity, survivor-centered platforms, database design, and structured storytelling. I approach each project as a reflection of growth, curiosity, and quiet revolution—where every line of code holds space for feeling.
